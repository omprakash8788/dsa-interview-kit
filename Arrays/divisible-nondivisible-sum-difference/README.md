##  Problem Statement
 - You are given positive integers n and m.
  - Define two integers as follows:
   - num1: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are not divisible by m.
   - num2: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are divisible by m.
 - Return the integer num1 - num2.


You are given two positive integers `n` and `m`.

Define:
- **num1** → sum of integers from `[1, n]` NOT divisible by `m`
- **num2** → sum of integers from `[1, n]` divisible by `m`

Return:  
`num1 - num2`

## 🧾 Examples

### Example 1
Input:  
n = 10, m = 3  

Output:  
19  

Explanation:  
- Not divisible → [1,2,4,5,7,8,10] → sum = 37  
- Divisible → [3,6,9] → sum = 18  
👉 37 - 18 = 19

### Example 2
Input:  
n = 5, m = 6  

Output:  
15
